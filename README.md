# CEP-8-Docs
Created an API doc for Adobe CEP8 because the files were already set up for jsdocs and I got tired of scrolling through the source code all the time. I did find doc sites for previous plugins, but the most recent ones I found were from CEP 6.
If there was already a site set up for CEP 8, well, no harm done.
